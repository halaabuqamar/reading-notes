## what is java script and whats its function 

*java script* allows you to make web pages more interactive by accessing and modifying the content and markeup used in a web page while its being viewed in the browser 

Computers approach tasks in a different way than
humans, so your instructions must let the computer
**solve the task prggrammatically**.
To approach writing a script, break down your goal into
a series of tasks and then work out each step needed
to complete that task 

A script is made up of a series of statements. Each
statement is like a step in a recipe.

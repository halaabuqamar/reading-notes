          <h1>Who is the Site For?</h1>
          <p>Every website should be designed for the
            target audience <ol>What is the age range of your target audience?
                ● Will your site appeal to more women or men? What is the mix?
                ● Which country do your visitors live in? What is the size of the company or relevant department?
                ● What is the position of people in the company who visit your site?
                ● Will visitors be using the site for themselves or for someone else?</ol></p>
                <h1>Why People Visit
                    YOUR Website</h1>
                    <p>Your content and design should
                        be influenced by the goals of
                        your users</p>
                        <h1>What Your Visitors are
                            Trying to Achieve</h1>
                            <p>It is unlikely that you will be able to list every
                                reason why someone visits your site but you
                                are looking for key tasks and motivations. This
                                information can help guide your site designs.</p>
                                <h1>What Information
                                    Your Visitors Need</h1>
                                    <p>You know who is coming to your site and why
                                        they are coming, so now you need to work out
                                        what information they need in order to achieve
                                        their goals quickly and effectively</p>
                                        <h1>Site Maps</h1>
                                        <p>The aim is to create a diagram
                                            of the pages that will be used
                                            to structure the site. This is
                                            known as a site map and it will
                                            show how those pages can be
                                            grouped.
                                            To help you decide what
                                            information should go on each
                                            page, you can use a technique
                                            called card sorting.
                                            This involves placing each
                                            piece of information that a
                                            visitor might need to know on
                                            a separate piece of paper and
                                            then organizing the related
                                            information into groups.
                                            Each group relates to a page and,
                                            on larger sites the, pages can in
                                            turn can be grouped together to
                                            create different sections of the
                                            website.</p>
                                            <h1>WireFrames
                                            </h1>
                                            <p>A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key
                                                information that needs to go on each page of a
                                                site. It shows the hierarchy of the information
                                                and how much space it might require.</p>
                                                <h1>Getting your message
                                                    across using design</h1>
                                                    <p>The primary aim of any kind of visual design
                                                        is to communicate. Organizing and prioritizing
                                                        information on a page helps users understand
                                                        its importance and what order to read it in.</p>

                                                        <p>Web pages often have a lot of
                                                            information to communicate.</p>

                                                    much harder to understand. (Key
                                                    messages would not stand out.)</p>

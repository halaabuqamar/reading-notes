### chapter 5:
##### images:
*Images can be used to set the tone for a site in less time than it takes to read a description*
because of that:

- Be relevant
- Convey information
- Convey the right mood
- Be instantly recognisable
- Fit the color palett

**Adding Images**
To add an image into the page you need to use an <img> element. This is an empty element (which means there is no closing tag). It must carry the following two attributes:
1. src This tells the browser where it can find the image file
2. alt This provides a text description of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it

*title You can also use the title attribute with the <img> element to provide additional information about the image*

You will also often see an <img>
element use two other attributes
that specify its size:
1 **height**
This specifies the height of the image in pixels.
2. **width**
This specifies the width of the image in pixels.

**Inline elements sit within a block level element and do not start on a new line**

The **align** attribute was commonly used to indicate how
the other parts of a page should flow around an image.

The align attribute can take these horizontal values:
- left
- right

Three Rules for Creating Images:
1. Save images in the right format
2. Save images at the right size
3. Use the correct resolution

Creating an image that is partially transparent (or "see-through") for the web involves
selecting one of two formats:
- Transparent GIF
- PNG 

note:*Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.*



### Chapter 11 :

**Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps convey the mood and evokes reactions.**


Foreground Color :The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside
an element
1. rgb values; rgb(102,205,170)
2. hex codes;#66cdaa
3. color names;MediumAquaMarine

**Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red,green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker.**

- Hue: is near to the colloquial idea of color. Technically speaking
however, a color can also have saturation and brightness as well as hue.

- Saturation: refers to the amount of gray in a color. At maximum
saturation, there would be nogray in the color. At minimum saturation, the color would be
mostly gray.

- Brightness: (or "value") refersto how much black is in a color. At maximum brightness, there would be no black in the color.At minimum brightness, the color would be very dark.

*The hsl color property has been introduced in CSS3 as an alternative way to specify colors.*


### Chapter12

The properties that allow you to controlthe appearance of text can be split into
two groups:
1. Those that directly affect the font and its appearance(including the typeface, whether it is regular, bold or italic,and the size of the text)
2. Those that would have the same effect on text no matter what font you were using (including the color of text andthe spacing between words and letters)

Typeface :
- Serif: Serif fonts have extra details on the ends of the main strokes of
the letters. These details are known as serifs.
- Sans-Serif:sans-serif fonts have straight ends to letters, and therefore have a much cleaner design.
- Monospace:every letter in a monospace (or fixed-width) font is the same
width. (Non-monospace fontshave different widths.)

**When choosinga typeface, it is important to understand that a browser will usually
only display it if it'sinstalled on that user's computer*

**Bold font-weight**
- normal:This causes text to appear at a
normal weight.
- bold:This causes text to appear bold.

**Styling Links**
:link, This allows you to set styles for links that have not yet been visited
:visited This allows you to set styles for links that have been clicked on. 

**:hover**
This is applied when a user hovers over an element with a pointing device such as a mouse. This has commonly been used to change the appearance of links and buttons when a user places their cursor over them

**:active**
This is applied when an element is being activated by a user; for
example, when a button is being pressed or a link being clicked

**:focus**
This is applied when an element has focus. Any element that you can interact with, such as a link you can click on or any form control can have focus.

###### Attribute Selectors

- **Existence** []Matches a specific attribute,p[class]
- **Equality** [=] Matches a specific attribute with a specific value,p[class="dog"]
- **Space** [~=] Matches a specific attribute whose value appears in a spaceseparated list of words,p[class~="dog"]
- **Prefix**[^=] Matches a specific attribute whose value begins with a specific string,p[attr^"d"]
- **SubString**[*=] Matches a specific attribute whose value contains a specific substring,p[attr*"do"]
- **Suffix** [$=] Matches a specific attribute whose value ends with a specific string p[attr$"g"]

* There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume most people will have installed.

* *You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or when they have visited a link*.

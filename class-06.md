##### WHAT IS AN OBJECT?
- Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model
of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object,
variables and functions take on new names

If a variable is part of an object, it is called a
**property**. Properties: tell us about the objec.

*VARIABLES BECOME KNOWN AS PROPERTIES*

- If a function is part of an object, it is called a **method**.
Methods represent tasks that are associated with
the object.

*FUNCTIONS BECOME KNOWN AS METHODS*

* CREATING· OBJECTS USING LITERAL NOTATION
- is the easiest and most popular way to create objects 



## Chapter 5 : 183-242

The **DOM** specifies the way in which the browser should structure this model using a DOM tree. 
*stored in the browsers' memory*

- THE DOCUMENT NODE 
- element node

* Accessing and updating the DOM tree involves two steps:
1. Locate the node that represents the element you want to work with.
2. Use its text content, child elements, and attributes. 

*method that find elemnets in the DOM tree is called Dom queries.*

DOM queries may return one element, or they may return a Nodelist,
which is a collection of nodes.

If a method can return *more than one node*, it will always return a Nodelist, which is a collection of
nodes (even if it only finds one matching element)

*FASTEST ROUTE* Finding the quickest way to access an element within your web page will make the page seem
faster and/or more responsive

**ELECTING ELEMENTS USING ID ATTRIBUTES**
get El ementByi d () allows you to select a single element node
by specifying the value of its id attribute. This method has one parameter: the value of the id attribute on
the element you want to select. This value is placed inside quote

**When a DOM method can return more than one element, it returns a Nodelist (even if it only finds one matching element).**

* There are two ways to select an element from a Nodelist: 
1. The item() method 
2. array syntax

select elemnts through:
- CLASS ATTRIBUTES 
- TAG NAME 
-  CSS SELECTORS

**LOOPING THROUGH A NODELIST**
 If you want to apply the same code to numerous elements, looping through a Nodelist is a powerful technique. 
- play by play

 **traversing the DOM.**
- parentNode 
- previousSibling
- nextSibling 
- firstChild
- lastChild 

*Most browsers, except IE, treat whitespace between elements (such as spaces or carriage returns) as a text node, so the properties below return different elements in different browsers:*

Using the i nnerHTML property, you can accessand amend the contents of an element,
including any child elements. 

If you add HTML to a page using i nnerHTML (or several jQuery methods),
you need to be aware of **Cross-Site Scripting Attacks** or **XSS**; otherwise,
an attacker could gain access to your users' accounts. 

FILTER OR VALIDATE INPUT The most basic defense is to prevent users from
entering characters into form fields that they do not need to use when providing that kind of information.

LIMIT WHERE USER CONTENT GOES Malicious users will not just use <script> tags to
try and create an XSS attack. As you saw on p228, malicious code can live in an event handler attribute
without being wrapped in <script> tags. XSS can also be triggered by malicious code in CSS or URLs

*Modern browsers come with tools that help you inspect the page loaded in the browser and understand the structure of the DOM tree.*
**In older browsers, implementation of the DOM is inconsistent (and is a popular reason for using jQuery).**

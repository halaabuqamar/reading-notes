One of the main reasons that people give up is compairing there work and achievments to others, 
**grass looks greener on the other side**

### Reminders for my self to keep yourself in a growth mindset:
1. Comfort zone is a black hole once you get in you'll never get out 
2. Help your self so you can help others by pulling them up with you 
3. Be the person you always wanted to be **Strong Succefull independent** 
~~GIVE UP~~

# Colors

# Foreground Color

The color property allows you
to specify the color of text inside
an element. You can specify any
color in CSS in one of three ways:
1. rgb values
These express colors in terms
of how much red, green and
blue are used to make it up. For
example: rgb(100,100,90)
2. hex codes
These are six-digit codes that
represent the amount of red,
green and blue in a color,
preceded by a pound or hash #
sign. For example: #ee3e80
3. color names
There are 147 predefined color
names that are recognized
by browsers. For example:
DarkCyan


* If you do not specify a
background color, then the
background is transparent* 

### Contrast
When picking foreground and background
colors, it is important to ensure that there is
enough contrast for the text to be legible
1. low
2. high
